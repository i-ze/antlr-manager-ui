# antlr-manager-ui
Tool to build custom script based logic on client side and run it later on server side

_TODO: find a better name_


This tool aims to provide generic solution for the following problem:
- create a UI where user can write custom logic as script
- the script language should be defined by the user
- both the UI and the backend side should be able to parse the script
- the server should be able to execute the script (by using provided parameters, environment variables, etc)


Features for the future:
- automatic syntax highlighting
- script validation
- code completion (language elements only)
- code completion (system built-in functions & environment variables)
- show execution result on the UI
- ??
